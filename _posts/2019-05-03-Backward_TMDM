In photoacoustic tomography, light absorption by molecules creats a thermally 
induced pressure jump that launches ultrasonic waves. The acoustic waves can be detected by transducers to form images. 
A imaging reconstruction case is studied in this example. 
The propagation of the emitted acoustic waves are simulated with the k-Wave toolbox. Then the received acoustic waves are
used to form the images with the TMDM backward projection.

Homogneous medium is used in this example. The k-Wave is first used to simulate the propagation of the emited acousitc waves from 
the 'mSOUND' shape. Then the singals received at the receiver located at the right-boundary shown in Figure 1(a) are assinged to the 
<a href="/mSOUND/function.html#Backward2D">Backward2D</a> as source_p. Figure 1(b) shows the reconstructed image with the 'mSOUND' shape.
