title: Photoacoustic image reconstruction in an absorbing acoustic medium using backward projection
---
<p>
<br>
<hr>
<hr>
This example is based on the example <a href="https://m-sound.github.io/mSOUND/Backward_TMDM">
Photoacoustic image reconstruction using backward projection</a>. Attenuation is considered in this case. We compared the reconstruction
images with and without considering the attenuation.

<h6>Defining the medium properties</h6>
<hr>
<p>
The forward propagation of the emitted ultrasonic wave from the source is simulated with the k-Wave toolbox. 
An initial source with the ‘mSOUND’ shape is used in this example. The medium properties for the forward propagation is shown below.
<pre><code>
<font color="#03a852">% assign the properties of the propagation medium</font>   
medium.sound_speed = 1500*ones(Nx, Ny);
medium.BonA        = 2.0*(0-1.0);
medium.density     = 1000*ones(Nx, Ny);
medium.alpha_coeff = 0.5; 
medium.alpha_power = 1.5;
 </code></pre>
