title: Photoacoustic image reconstruction in an absorbing acoustic medium using backward projection

This example is based on the example <a href="https://m-sound.github.io/mSOUND/Backward_TMDM">
Photoacoustic image reconstruction using backward projection</a>. Attenuation is considered in this case. We compared the reconstruction
images with and without considering the attenuation.

<h6>Defining the medium properties</h6>
<hr>
<p>
The forward propagation of the emitted ultrasonic wave from the source is simulated with the k-Wave toolbox. 
An initial source with the ‘mSOUND’ shape is used in this example. The medium properties for the forward propagation is shown below.
<pre><code>
<font color="#03a852">% assign the properties of the propagation medium</font>   
medium.sound_speed = 1500*ones(Nx, Ny);
medium.BonA        = 2.0*(0-1.0);
medium.density     = 1000*ones(Nx, Ny);
medium.alpha_coeff = 0.5; 
medium.alpha_power = 1.5;
 </code></pre>
The source reconstruction is conducted with the function <a href="/mSOUND/function.html#Backward2D">Backward2D</a>
in mSOUND. The figure (a) below shows the reconstruction with 
assuming a lossless medium and figure (b) below shows the reconstruction with considering the the effects from
attenuation and dispersion. When absorption and dispersion are considered, backward projection is more accurate.
Moreover, mSOUND automatically takes these effects into account in backward projection.
