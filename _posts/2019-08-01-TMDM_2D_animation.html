Due to the periodic property of Fourier Transform, the total temporal domain size in TMDM can be chosen as small as the 
pulse length to save computation time and computer memeory. Though a smaller temporal domain won't affact the pressure field, 
artifical signals will apear in the animation when the temproal domain is smaller than the real propagation time.

This example is based on the example
<a href="https://m-sound.github.io/mSOUND/TMDM_2D_heterogeneous">Simulation of a
2D homogeneous medium using the transient mixed domain method</a>. Two different temporal domain sizes are used and they are 
<span style="background-color:#f1f1f1">t_length = 8.0000e-06</span>
and <span style="background-color:#f1f1f1">t_length = 3.2000e-05</span>.
<pre>
code>
p_total = Forward2D(mgrid, medium, source_p, sensor_mask, reflection_order, 'animation');

The first figure shows the snapshot of the animation for the simulation with <span style="background-color:#f1f1f1">t_length = 8.0000e-06</span>.
The second figure shows the snapshot of the animaiton for the simulation with <span style="background-color:#f1f1f1">t_length = 3.2000e-05</span>.
In the first figure, only the right-most signal is the real signal while the following signals are the artifical ones from 
the Fourier transform due to the peoridic perperty. The second figure is more clean and only the real singal shows up in the snapshot.
