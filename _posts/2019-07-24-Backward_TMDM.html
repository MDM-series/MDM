title: Image reconstruction using backward projection

In photoacoustic tomography (PAT), for example, short-pulses of laser are first delivered into biological tissues, 
which are to be absorbed by the tissue, particularly the blood vessels. Ultrasonic waves are consequently produced via thermos-
elastic expansion. By projecting the ultrasonic wave backward toward the tissue (in a way similar to time-reversal),
the initial ultrasonic pressure distribution can be recognized, rendering an image of the vessels. 
This can be used to characterize the tissue properties. The forward propagation of the emitted ultrasonic wave from the source 
is simulated with the k-Wave toolbox. The received signals are backward projected with the mSOUND toolbox for the initial source 
image reconstruction.

An initial source with the ‘mSOUND’ shape is used in this example for the illustration of the simulation with backward projection. 
The <span style="background-color:#f1f1f1">source_p</span>
required for the function <a href="/mSOUND/function.html#Backward2D">Backward2D</a> is the signals recorded at the right boundary 
of Figure. a, generated by k-Wave. Figure. b shows the reconstructed source distribution with the time-reversal algorithm in k-Wave and 
Figure. c shows the same source distribution with the backward projection in mSOUND.
