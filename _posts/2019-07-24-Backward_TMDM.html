In photoacoustic tomography, short-pulses of laser light are first delivered into biological tissues. 
Some of the light energy will be absorbed by the tissue. Ultrasonic waves will then be produced by the tissue part 
through thermoelastic expansion. By projecting the ultrasonic wave backward to the tissue,  
the initial ultrasonic wave distribution can be recognized. This can be used to characterize the tissue properties. 
The propagation of the emitted ultrasonic wave from the source is simulated with the k-Wave toolbox. 
The received signals are propagated with the TMDM backward projection.

Homogneous medium is assumed in this example. The k-Wave is first used to simulate the propagation of the emitted acousitc waves from 
the 'mSOUND' source. Then the singal received at the linear receiver located at the right boundary of the Fig. (a) is assinged 
to the backward projection function<a href="/mSOUND/function.html#Backward2D">Backward2D</a> as source pressure. Figure (b) shows the recovered source distribution 
with the time-reversal algorithm in the k-Wave and Fig. (c) shows the recovered source distribution with the backward projection 
in the mSOUND.
