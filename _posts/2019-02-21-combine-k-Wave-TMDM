This example shows how to implement the <a href="http://www.k-wave.org/">k-Wave</a> for simulations with curved transducer.
Temporally, only phased array transducer can be used for simulating focused beams in the mSOUND. If other transducer settings
are required, people can first use k-Wave to propagate the wave field for a small distance and record the data at a plane. 
Then implement the recorded data at the plane to the TMDM.
