title: Add absorption layer to the FSMDM

Adding absorption layer can help reduce the spatial aliasing error. But if the absorption is too strong, the acoustic field will become 
inaccurate due to excess absoprtion. On the other hand, if the absoprtion is too small, then the aliasing error cannot be reduced.
In this case, the effect of absorption layer is investigated by setting up different
 <span style="background-color:#f1f1f1">medium.absorb_gamma</span> and <span style="background-color:#f1f1f1">medium.absorb_alpha</span>.

This simulation setup is based on the 
   <a href="https://m-sound.github.io/mSOUND/FSMDM_2D_homogeneous">
  Simulation in the 2D homogeneous media using the frequency-specific mixed domain method</a>. Computational domain and simulation 
  setup are the same in the two cases. In this case, three pairs of 
 <span style="background-color:#f1f1f1">medium.absorb_gamma</span> and <span style="background-color:#f1f1f1">medium.absorb_alpha</span>
 are studied and they are: 
 <span style="background-color:#f1f1f1">medium.absorb_gamma = 0.1</span> and <span style="background-color:#f1f1f1">medium.absorb_alpha=0.5</span>,
 <span style="background-color:#f1f1f1">medium.absorb_gamma = 0.5</span> and <span style="background-color:#f1f1f1">medium.absorb_alpha=0.2</span>, and
 <span style="background-color:#f1f1f1">medium.absorb_gamma = 0.8</span> and <span style="background-color:#f1f1f1">medium.absorb_alpha=0.08</span>. 
 The pressure distribution along the central axia simulated at different absorption layer configurations are shown in the figure below. For 
 each simulation case, coefficients for the absorption layer should be selected carefully.
