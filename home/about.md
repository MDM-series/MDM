## Introduction ##
***   
MDM-series is an open-source toolbox for MATLAB and developed by [Juanjuan Gu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juanjuan_Gu) and [Yun Jing](https://www.mae.ncsu.edu/people/yjing2). This toolbox is intended for modeling one-way linear/nonlinear wave propagation in biological tissue with arbitrary heterogeneities, in which speed of sound, density, attenuation coefficients, power law exponent and nonlinear coefficients are all spatially varying functions. In the current version, MDM-series contains two methods for modeling nonlinear wave proapgation and they are transient mixed-domain method (TMDM) and frequency-specific mixed-domain method (FSMDM). TMDM can generate the simulaiton results in the transient domain and FSMDM generates the simulaiton results directly at the specific frequencies of interest.

Since FSMDM is dubbed from the TMDM based on the quasilinear approximation (Mach number epsilon << 1), therefore, TMDM should be chosen for strongly nonlinear wave propagation simulation.
